# Description
In this test, I created a Git repository for CustomerOrder, Inventory, and CustomerOrderTest java files. I created issues for the 5 test cases I needed to add to CustomerOrderTest.java. I created branches for each issue and added the test cases. I committed the branches and then made pull requests and finally merged each branch into the main branch.
